# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# if you want to write name in variable  then you will write any name 
# in "  " these inverted comas  that will called string variable 

myname :str = 'haseeb ahmed '

Myname :str = 'haseeb ahmed'

MY_Father_Name : str = 'naeem ahmed'

grade : str = 'A'

city_name : str = 'Karachi'


# if you want to write number in  variable  then you will write any numeric 
#   that will called intiger  variable 
# like this 


Age : int = 22

price_of_car : int = 1222222




# variable  in true false

is_student : bool = True

is_open : bool = False
